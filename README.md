# mic-monitor-control
A simple Python/Tkinter app to control PulseAudio microphone monitoring (listen to microphone)

# Why
I wanted to be able to use TVs for my presentations, and as the amplifier for my audio as well.  PaulseAudio Volume Control seems to have had this feature in the past, but it seems to be gone now.

# How to install

1. Download mic-monitor.py
2. ```chmod +x mic-monitor.py```
3. ```./mic-monitor.py```

Should work on most Debian-based distros. (Ubuntu, Mint, Zorin OS, Pop, etc.) It might work on others, but won't automatically install dependeencies, since we rely on ```apt```.
